# Sybila

This is a modified version of the original Sybila theme. If you want to check out the repo for that, it is on Github aswell. Check out the repo that I forked from.

I made some slight modifications to the original, including a table of contents before every new section showing all subsections of the next one and "correct" colors for bulletpoints and the tableofcontents.

Feel free to use, modify and distribute this without my permission, but check out the license of the original theme before doing something stupid.

The following is from the original Readme:
